We are proposing a system which is capable of remote monitoring and control system for
hospitals which will overcome the constant manual monitoring in the present system which is
time consuming job and huge use of manpower causes unnecessary disturbance to critical
patients. The Arduino Mega2560 hardware platform is the proposed platform for controlling
the whole system along with 4Ã—4 matrix keypad (for manual control in case of emergency),
smart phone (for remote access via web application or android application) and Wi-Fi module
to control the flow of saline. The delineated flow sensor will be hanged in the drip chamber of
the saline bottle to calculate the saline flow rate. The obtained outputs from sensor are
continuously verified by the program and if any mismatch is found, the Arduino moves the
servo motor to recalibrate the circulation rate to balance with the assigned flow rate. A speech
recognition technique will also be present for the patient through which the concerned
message is either sent to relatives or the nurse/doctor, depending upon the calculated
frequency of the spoken words (message).
